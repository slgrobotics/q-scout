# Robobloq Q-Scout Robot under QmindX ESP32

This is a collection of my notes and useful info related to Q-Scout and its QmindX controller.

Previous 2018 versions of the controller - **Qmind** and **Qmind Plus** - were based on **Atmega 328 / 2560** ("Arduino UNO / Mega")

There are many sources of information for these boards, including schematics (see Links).

Current 2021 version - **QmindX** - is based on ESP32, and information is scarce.

Very good info here (use Chrome right click to translate): https://github.com/aretche/recursos-robobloq

## Links:

Some materials from these links can be found in my Docs folder here.

## And here is Amazon review which I, unfortunately, have to agree with:

Don't read me wrong - Q-Scout hardware is fantastic in quality, QmindX is very well designed, powerful and high quality product, and underlying firmware/library is very good.

But the company, in my opinion, dropped the ball when it failed to deliver documentation for all the above, thus limiting average user's learning experience to a Scratch-programmed toy.

For a true educational robot, the Support site should have thorough documentation on how to use it outside of MyQode/Scratch "closed ecosystem", and how to program it with C++ and Python.

## Coding in Arduino IDE

While there's complete lack of info on this from the official site, there is a simple trick that allows coding in Arduino IDE

Here is how: https://github.com/slgrobotics/q-scout/blob/main/Code/README.md
