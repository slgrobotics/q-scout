# Robobloq Q-Scout Robot under QmindX ESP32

This is a collection of my notes and useful info related to Q-Scout and its QmindX controller.

Previous 2018 versions of the controller - **Qmind** and **Qmind Plus** - were based on **Atmega 328 / 2560** ("Arduino UNO / Mega")

There are many sources of information for these boards, including schematics (see Links).

Current 2021 version - **QmindX** - is based on ESP32, and information is scarce.
