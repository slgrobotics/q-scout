# Robobloq Q-Scout Robot under QmindX ESP32



This is a collection of my notes and useful info related to Q-Scout and its QmindX controller.

![71E4wJKAVDL _AC_SX679_](https://github.com/slgrobotics/q-scout/assets/16037285/c95d8746-aee3-4d95-a2e3-3a701360142f)

Previous 2018 versions of the controller - **Qmind** and **Qmind Plus** - were based on **Atmega 328 / 2560** ("Arduino UNO / Mega")

There are many sources of information for these boards, including schematics (see Links).

Current 2021 version - **QmindX** - is based on ESP32, and information is scarce.

## And here is Amazon review which I, unfortunately, have to agree with:

#### Don't get me wrong though -
Q-Scout hardware is fantastic in quality, QmindX is very well designed, powerful and high quality product, and underlying firmware/library is actually very good.

But the company, in my opinion, dropped the ball when it failed to deliver documentation for all the above, thus limiting average user's learning experience to a Scratch-programmed toy.

For a true educational robot, the Support site should have thorough documentation on how to use it outside of MyQode/Scratch "closed ecosystem", and how to program it with C++ and Python.

## But, there is hope - Coding in C++ with Arduino IDE

While there's complete lack of info on this from the official site, there is a simple trick that allows coding in Arduino IDE - the same as you would for Arduino UNO and alike.

Here is how: https://github.com/slgrobotics/q-scout/blob/main/Code/README.md
